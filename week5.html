        <h2>Week 5</h2>
        <h3>Notes and Code Examples from <i>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition</i></h3>

        <div class="codesection">
            <p>Strict Mode</p>
            <p>Not using strict mode is often referred to as 'sloppy mode' as it’s forgiving of sloppy programming
                practices. Strict mode encourages a better quality of JavaScript to be written that befits a ninja
                programmer, so its use is recommended.

                Strict mode simply requires the following string to be added to the first line of a JavaScript file:</p>

            <code>'use strict';</code>
            <p>Linting</p>
            <p>Linting tools such asJS Lint,JS Hint,andES Lintcan be used to test the quality of JavaScript code, beyond
                simply using strict mode. </p>
            <p>Passing a lint test is no guarantee that your code is correct, but it will mean it will be more
                consistent and less likely to have problems.</p>
            <p>Debugging</p>
            <p>By debugging in the browser, you can create breakpoints to find where your error is.</p>
            <p>Debugging using alert()</p>
            <p>By placing alert() within your code, you can see whether certain sections are running
                properly or not.
            </p>
            <p>Error objects</p>
            <p>The following error objects can be used to handle potential errors in a program:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>EvalError is not used in the current ECMAScript specification and only retained for backwards
                    compatibility. It was used to identify errors when using the global eval() function.
                </li>
                <li>RangeError is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.
                </li>
                <li>ReferenceError is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn’t exist. For example,
                    calling a function that hasn't been defined.
                </li>
                <li>SyntaxError is thrown when there’s an error in the code’s syntax.
                </li>
                <li>TypeError is thrown when there’s an error in the type of value used; for example, a string is used
                    when a number is expected.
                </li>
                <li>URIError is thrown when there’s a problem encoding or decoding the URI.
                </li>
                <li>InternalError is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in the JavaScript engine.
                    A common cause of this too much recursion.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Throwing Exceptions</p>
            <p>The throw statement can be applied to any JavaScript expression, causing the execution of the program to stop. </p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <code>
                function squareRoot(number) {<br>
                    'use strict';<br>
                    if (number < 0) {<br>
                        throw new RangeError('You can't find the square root of negative numbers')<br>
                    }<br>
                    return Math.sqrt(number);<br>
                };<br>
            </code>
            <p>Exception Handling with try, catch, and finally</p>
            <p>If we suspect a piece of code will result in an exception, we can wrap it in a try block</p>
            <p>This will run the code inside the block as normal, but if an exception occurs it will pass 
                the error object that is thrown onto a catch block. </p>
                <p>The code inside the catch block will only run if an exception is thrown inside the try block. 
                    The error object is automatically passed as a parameter to the catch block. This allows us to 
                    query the error name, message and stack properties, and deal with it appropriately.</p>
                    <p>A finally block can be added after a catch block. This will always be executed after the try or catch block, 
                        regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.</p>
                        <p>Test-driven Development</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Similar to pseudo code in Java</li>
                            <li>Write tests (that initially fail)</li>

                                <li>Write code to pass the tests</li>
                                
                               <li> Refactor the code</li>
                                
                                <li>Test refactored code</li>
                                
                                <li>Write more tests for new features</li>
                        </ul>

        <h4>Code Examples</h4>
        <p></p>
        <div class="codesection">
            <p>A Stack Trace is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead
                to the point where the error occurred. It’s often not just a single
                function or method call that causes an error. A stack trace will work
                backwards from the point at which the error occurred to identify the
                original function or method that started the sequence. The example below
                shows how a stack trace can help you find where an error originates from:</p>
            <code>
                function three(){ unicorn(); }<br>
                function two(){ three(); }<br>
                function one(){ two(); }<br>
                one();<br>
                index.html:13 Uncaught ReferenceError: unicorn is not defined<br>
                at three (index.html:13)<br>
                at two (index.html:17)<br>
                at one (index.html:21)<br>
                at index.html:24`<br>
            </code>
            <p>In this example, we have three functions: function one() invokes
                function two() , which then invokes function three() . Function
                three() then invokes the unicorn() function that doesn't exist and
                causes an error. We can use the stack trace to work backwards and
                see that this error was caused by invoking the function one() in
                the first place.</p>



            <p>Questions:</p>
            <p>I would like to know some ways to practice exception handling in a progressive
                way (step by step) in writing a basic program that isn't overly complex.
